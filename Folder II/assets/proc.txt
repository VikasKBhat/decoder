- The circuit simulated is as shown in the below image.
- Click the input switches to select the required inputs named "x", "y", "z" and "w". Switch in the on state is <img> and off state is <img>.
- The simulation will display corresponding output. Output is displayed as a glowing bulb
- Press the "ADD" button to display the output in truth table. Verify the input values and corresponding output values from the truth table
- At specific positions, small switches <img> make the lines stuck-at-0. Clicking them simulates SA0 faults at the said locations.
- There can be multiple SA0 faults on a single line at different locations.
- Repeat above steps for all possible inputs and obtain the truth table.
