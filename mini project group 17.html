<p>A Stuck-at fault (SAF) is a logic-level fault that mimics a manufacturing defect on a digital device, circuits, etc. A Stuck-at-Fault is of two types:
stuck-at-0 (SA0) and stuck-at-1 (SA1) fault. Stuck at faults occur when a line is permanently stuck to Vcc or ground giving a faulty output. This line may 
be an input or output to any gate. Also this fault can be single or multiple stuck at faults, Although in this experiment we will only talk about single stuck 
at faults. 
<br>example of stuck-at-0  :-

<br>A fault model is an engineering model of something that could go wrong in the construction
or operation of a piece of equipment.
From the model, the designer or user can then predict the consequences of this particular fault.
To detect such fault, a suitable fault model is used.The user deliberately make Vcc or grounded positions and checks output. The user checks all types
of faults that may occur in the circuit.

<p>
The parallel inputs x, y & z are applied to each 3 to 8 decoder. The complement of input, w is connected to Enable, E of upper 3 to 8 decoder in order
to get the outputs, D0 to D7. These are the first eight minterms. The input, w is directly connected to Enable, E of lower 3 to 8 decoder in order to get 
the outputs, D8 to D15. These are the last eight minterms.</p>

<p>when the w is at logic '0' the above decoder is turned on and gives output (D0 to D7), and when w is at logic '1' the below decoder is turned on and gives output
(D8 to D15).The truth table of the 4 to 16 decoder is as follows :-</p>

<h1><B><U>Procedure</U></B></h1>

<h3>1. SA0 fault on x input wire</h3>
Let us consider the case of a SA0 fault at the position shown below.<br>
<p align = "center"><img src= "images/x_1.png" width = 40%></p>
<p>When this happens, the value of x is always changed to zero regardless of which decoder is activated. Therefore, the output lines that require x to be 1 will never be high, instead the output line corresponding to the same input with x = 0 will be high. For instance, if we give 1100 as the input, output line D12 should be high in case of normal operation. Since we have a SA0 fault, output line corresponding to 1000 (D8) will be high instead. </p>
The expected as well as obtained truth table are given below: <br><br>
<img src = "images/x_fault1.png" width = 100%><br><br><br>
Now consider the case of a SA0 fault at a slightly different position.<br>
<p align = "center"><img src = "images/x_2.png" width = 40%></p>
<p>Now, the effects of the fault are visible only when the first decoder is active. If an input activates the second decoder instead, the output is as expected. 
When the first decoder is active, the value of x will be changed to 0 regardless of the provided input. Once again, the output lines that require x to be 1 will not be high, instead the output line corresponding to the same input with x = 0 will be high. For example, if we provide 0101 as the input, the output line corresponding to 0001 (D1) will be high. </p>
The truth tables for this case are given below:<br><br>
<img src = "images/x_fault2.png" width = 100%><br><br><br>
Finally, let us consider the SA0 fault to be at the following position.<br>
<p align = "center"><img src = "images/x_3.png" width = 40%></p>
<p>This case, in a sense, is the opposite of the previous case. If the input activates the first decoder, the output is as expected. The fault only affects the inputs activating the second decoder.</p>
<p>When the second decoder is active, the value of x will be changed to 0 because of the fault. The output lines that require x to be 1 will never be high, since x will be converted to 0. For example, if the input is 1111(D15), the output line for 1011(D11) will be high.</p>
The truth tables for this case are given below:<br><br>
<img src = "images/x_fault3.png" width = 100%><br><br><br>
SA0 fault on y or z wires will lead to similar cases, with some outputs always being low and other outputs being high for multiple inputs.
